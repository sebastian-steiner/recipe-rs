# recipe-rs
A rust web server to host a personal list of recipes to cook again.

This web server allows federated access to a database in which recipes and the times they were cooked is stored.

## Use cases
- When thinking about what to cook, I found that I always forget about good recipes I once cooked and so tend to repeat the same few things. This web server, or more precisely a front end to it, helps me find which recipes I cooked long enough ago to cook again, but liked well enough for a repeat to be a good idea.

- After cooking I more likely than not, find some small changes I would have liked to make to the recipe based on the results. Through *recipe-rs* it is possible for me to add an image and some short notes to the recipe for me to remember the next time I try to make something.

- I never really found myself using the filtering options on existing sites/apps, but I wish for recipe tipps based on the ingredients I have on hand. If I spend the time to manually enter all the provided ingredients and correct the amount of servings, I can more precicely filter based on these parameters.

- Maybe you don't want your recipes out in the wild for everyone to see. Since *recipe-rs* is self-hosted, you and you alone are in charge of who gets to see, edit or create new recipes.
